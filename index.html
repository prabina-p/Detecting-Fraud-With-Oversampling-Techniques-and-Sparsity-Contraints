                    <h4 class="my-3">Motivation</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">In recent years, there has been a huge surge in the usage of online platforms like Reddit,
                        Yelp, and Amazon. While the usage of such platforms has positively influenced our daily
                        lives, fraudulent activities is amid this rapid increase in digital data volume and anonymity
                        of online networks. Fraudulent behaviors are executed and hidden in plain sight of this
                        vast amount of online records. Thus, enhancing fraud detection is crucial to protect us
                        from fraudsters against harmful scams, and even criminal activities.

                    <h4 class="my-3">Need For Better Fraud Detection Method</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Many techniques exist to combat fraud; 
                        however, they often fail to capture the imbalancement in class data involving 
                        fraudulent activities. It’s important to tackle such concern so we can harness its
                        power to correctly predict anomalies. So, the question remains: How can we
                        effectively detect and mitigate fraudulent activities, especially when faced
                        with imbalanced datasets? Our research contributes to the study of such 
                        concern with a model that harnesses the benefits of many existing models. We
                        propose a solution that utilizes a combination of oversampling techniques and
                        sparsity constraints to balance and predict fraud data.

                    <h4 class="my-3">Our Proposed Solution</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">So, our proposed solution is the combination of 2 models: GraphSmote and SparseGAD.
                        GraphSmote, although not commonly
                        used for fraud detection, is an oversampling technique that identifies minority class nodes
                        and creates new nodes that resemble those minority class data points, thus helping it 
                        balance. Since datasets involving fraud detection are hugely imbalanced, GraphSmote will
                        help us balance the class distribution in the graph. We will then take the output of this
                        GraphSmote and feed it into SparseGAD, known for anomaly detection by introducing 
                        sparsity constraints. Such constraints help highlight significant connections, and anything that
                        substantially deviates from that will be looked into further for fraud. We will discuss our
                        model in more detail in the Methods section of this paper.
                        By tackling this fraud detection task, we hope to contribute to protecting us against scams.

                <p class='text-muted'>

                    How over-sampling words in GraphSmote is by the model generating synthetic nodes. 
                    First, we determine which class label belongs to the minority class, which in our case, is the anomalous users, 
                    as they generally occur less frequently than the common users. 
                    To generate synthetic nodes to amplify the minority class, 
                    we use the upsampling method to randomly replicate nodes and reproduce their connections with their neighbors, 
                    as seen in the image below. The reason we aim for identical neighbors for the synthetic nodes is to maintain a 
                    similar level of heterogeneity for the links of the minority classes. We then add randomized minor differences in 
                    the features of synthetic nodes to create distinctions between synthetic nodes and the original nodes, as in the 
                    SMOTE method.

                <h3> How SparseGAD works </h3>
                <p class='text-muted'>

                    Overcoming sparsity task arose from the concern about the nature of anomalous users camouflaging themselves 
                    among the common users. Thus, we added sparsification method from SparseGAD as seen on the figure below 
                    to filter out elements in the adjacency matrix. We will use a delta as the threshold to remove unnecessary 
                    neighbors.

                        Fraud detection is prevalent now more than ever due to the massive surge in the usage of online platforms.
                        Our research contributes to the study of such concern with a model that harnesses the benefits of many 
                        existing models. We proposed a solution that utilizes a combination of oversampling techniques and 
                        sparsity constraints to balance and predict fraud data.

                        We’d like to expand our model to other datasets. 
                        The three datasets were a test-run. We'd like to deploy our model in other datasets
                        to make sure our predictions are within standards.

                        We’d also like to finetune our model further.
                        We performed hyperparameter tuning during GraphSmote phase.
                        We'd like to continue experimenting with which hyperparameters are best fit.

                        We are also interested in obtaining a partnership to deploy this model.
                        As we mentioned, online fraud detection can be catastrophic to many and results in a lot of negative impression of internet.
                        We'd like to help bridge cybersecurity fraud.

                        Combination of GraphSmote and SparseGAD, as we can see, produced good results.

                        However, there are many more models that exist. 

                        We will need to find combinations of them which will be the most powerful in detecting fraud.

                        Subject matter expertise and domain knowledge will be pinnacle in research of this domain
                        to get the best model.

                                    Here, we see which U.S. states are most represented in our dataset. We note that
                                    among the most represented are the most populous -- Texas, California, Florida, etc.

                                    However, we also note that there is a strong Republican presence in the dataset,
                                    which also helps to explain the overwhelming negative Tweet count, as the Republican
                                    party has been consistently negative in their attiude towards China across the
                                    dataset's timeframe.
